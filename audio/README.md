### `bell.mp3`
- A single church bell "bong" sound

- This plays N times on the hour (e.g., 8 times at 8 o'clock)

### `wormhole.mp3`
- A sci-fi "whooshing" or humming tunnel sound
- Should loop seamlessly (or be long enough for typical travel time)
- Think Stargate activation, warp drive, or DS9 wormhole

### `arrival.mp3`
- A short "arrival" or "materialization" sound
- Plays when exiting the wormhole
- 1-2 seconds, dramatic but not startling
