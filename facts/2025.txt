SYSTEM STATUS: Quantum flux capacitors operating at 98.7% efficiency. The remaining 1.3% is used for snacks.
TEMPORAL COORDINATES LOCKED: Year 2025 CE. Please keep all limbs inside the time stream at all times.
The UC Oakland Center for Quantum Chronodynamics is not responsible for paradoxes, grandfather issues, or accidentally becoming your own ancestor.
The Institute for Applied History reminds you that the past is a foreign country—they do things differently there, and the exchange rate is terrible.
Temporal displacement may cause temporary disorientation, déjà vu, or the sudden urge to invest in companies that haven't been founded yet.
This unit operates on 1.21 gigawatts of pure historical curiosity and grant funding.
If you experience any timeline divergence, please file Form TD-7 with the Department of Chronological Corrections.
Replaced the flux inhibitor coil. Again. Dr. Henderson really needs to stop microwaving burritos near the temporal core.
The Institute would like to remind all travelers that "technically not invented yet" is not a valid excuse for patent applications.
This time machine was assembled using parts from three different centuries. We're pretty sure we got them all from the right timelines.
The wormhole may appear closer than it actually is. Or further. Honestly, distance gets weird when you're folding spacetime.
If you meet yourself in the past, do not make eye contact. It's not dangerous, just really awkward.
Please stand by. Good things come to those who wait. Especially when dealing with non-linear time.
The vending machine in the break room only accepts currency from the current timeline. We learned this the hard way.
All chroniton levels nominal. Tachyon emissions within acceptable parameters. Coffee machine refilled.
You are currently standing at the exact midpoint between the first powered flight (1903) and... well, we can't spoil that one.
The temporal drive requires exactly 1.21 jigawatts of enthusiasm. We may have misspelled that in the documentation.
Previous time travelers have reported mild existential reflection upon returning to the present. This is normal and usually resolves with snacks.
Our timeline has been rated "mostly stable" by the Interdimensional Standards Committee. That's passing!
Did you know humans have only been recording history for about 5,000 years? Before that, it was all "oral tradition" and "hoping someone remembered."
If you compressed Earth's history into 24 hours, modern humans would appear at 11:59:56 PM. We're the last-minute guests.
Please do not attempt to bring any cryptocurrency back from the future. We learned this creates what we call "economic paradox cascades."
The viewing portal has been cleaned. Previous travelers kept touching it with their popcorn fingers.
In at least three parallel timelines, this exact party is happening. In one of them, disco never died.
Reality anchors holding at 100%. Last reality fluctuation was minor—someone briefly experienced Wednesday on a Thursday.
Yes, we know the wormhole sounds like it's humming a pop song. Dr. Kowalski tuned it that way. We can't change it.
The Institute's time machine was actually invented in 2089, then sent back in time for assembly. The paperwork was a nightmare.
If the destination year looks pixelated, that's just the quantum uncertainty resolving itself. Give it a moment.
Is AI going to save us or destroy us? The discourse ranges from "helpful tool" to "existential threat" with surprisingly little middle ground.
Every era thinks it's living through the most important moment in history. They're all correct and none of them are. Perspective is weird.
Remote work—productivity revolution or death of workplace culture? Managers and employees have... different perspectives.
Climate discourse is at peak intensity. Solutions exist. Agreement on which ones doesn't. The planet is watching.
Is social media connecting us or fragmenting society? Both. The answer is definitely both. This makes nobody happy.
The attention economy has made "going viral" more valuable than being correct. The Institute recommends touching grass occasionally.
Are streaming services killing cinema or saving it? People will argue about this in movie theater parking lots.
2025 humans spend an average of 7 hours a day looking at glowing rectangles. The Institute does not judge. The time machine is also a glowing rectangle.
What even ARE the current generations called? Gen Alpha? Gen Beta? Zoomers? Naming conventions are themselves controversial.
The Institute does not comment on current political affairs. We've seen how it plays out. Still not saying.
Is space exploration a billionaire vanity project or humanity's future? Bezos and Musk fans are fighting in orbit.
Student loan discourse is exactly as contentious in 2025 as it was in 2020. Some debates are truly timeless.
What counts as "real" music? Instruments vs. laptops. Every generation has this argument. It resolves when the next generation comes along.
Vinyl records outsold CDs for the first time in decades. The past is now a premium product.
Is hustle culture inspiring or exploitative? "Rise and grind" vs "rest is productive" wars rage on LinkedIn.
Debates about new technology (printing press, telegraph, radio, TV, internet, AI) follow remarkably similar patterns across centuries.
If you're from the past, don't stare at phones. Everyone has one. Act like a glowing rectangle that contains all human knowledge is completely normal.
If asked for your opinion, say "it's complicated" or "I see both sides." This is the safest response to almost any 2025 topic.
Don't pay with cash. It's suspicious now. Use a card or phone. If you have coins, people will think you're collecting them ironically.
Know that "that's so based" is a compliment, "mid" is an insult, and "no cap" means "I'm being serious." Language has evolved.
If someone shows you a meme, laugh. Even if you don't understand it. Asking for explanations marks you as an outsider.
Don't express surprise at video calls. Talking to a tiny face in a rectangle is just... how people communicate now.
If you're from the future, don't spoil anything. Seriously. The Institute has protocols. Also, we don't believe you anyway.
Food allergies and dietary preferences are normal conversation topics. Don't act shocked when someone says they're "plant-based."
Tipping culture is confusing to everyone, including people from 2025. If unsure, tip 20%. It's easier than the math.
Everyone is tired. If asked how you're doing, "exhausted but fine" is a universally understood response.
If a stranger mentions their "content," they probably make videos. Everyone is a potential influencer now. Just nod supportively.
BLENDING IN TIP: Climate change is real, the discourse is endless, and nobody wants to talk about it at parties. Read the room.
