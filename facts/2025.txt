SYSTEM STATUS: Quantum flux capacitors operating at 98.7% efficiency. The remaining 1.3% is used for snacks.
TEMPORAL COORDINATES LOCKED: Year 2025 CE. Please keep all limbs inside the time stream at all times.
SAFETY NOTICE: The UC Oakland Center for Quantum Chronodynamics is not responsible for paradoxes, grandfather issues, or accidentally becoming your own ancestor.
CALIBRATION IN PROGRESS: The Institute for Applied History reminds you that the past is a foreign country—they do things differently there, and the exchange rate is terrible.
WARNING: Temporal displacement may cause temporary disorientation, déjà vu, or the sudden urge to invest in companies that haven't been founded yet.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: This unit operates on 1.21 gigawatts of pure historical curiosity and grant funding.
OPERATOR NOTE: If you experience any timeline divergence, please file Form TD-7 with the Department of Chronological Corrections.
MAINTENANCE LOG: Replaced the flux inhibitor coil. Again. Dr. Henderson really needs to stop microwaving burritos near the temporal core.
SYSTEM ADVISORY: The Institute for Applied History would like to remind all travelers that "technically not invented yet" is not a valid excuse for patent applications.
FUN FACT: This time machine was assembled using parts from three different centuries. We're pretty sure we got them all from the right timelines.
CAUTION: The wormhole may appear closer than it actually is. Or further. Honestly, distance gets weird when you're folding spacetime.
PRO TIP: If you meet yourself in the past, do not make eye contact. It's not dangerous, just really awkward.
LOADING TEMPORAL DATA: Please stand by. Good things come to those who wait. Especially when dealing with non-linear time.
NOTICE: The vending machine in the break room only accepts currency from the current timeline. We learned this the hard way.
SYSTEM CHECK: All chroniton levels nominal. Tachyon emissions within acceptable parameters. Coffee machine refilled.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: You are currently standing at the exact midpoint between the first powered flight (1903) and... well, we can't spoil that one.
CALIBRATION NOTE: The temporal drive requires exactly 1.21 jigawatts of enthusiasm. We may have misspelled that in the documentation.
SYSTEM LOG: Previous time travelers have reported mild existential reflection upon returning to the present. This is normal and usually resolves with snacks.
INSTITUTE BULLETIN: Our timeline has been rated "mostly stable" by the Interdimensional Standards Committee. That's passing!
LOADING HISTORICAL DATA: Did you know humans have only been recording history for about 5,000 years? Before that, it was all "oral tradition" and "hoping someone remembered."
TEMPORAL TRIVIA: If you compressed Earth's history into 24 hours, modern humans would appear at 11:59:56 PM. We're the last-minute guests.
SAFETY ADVISORY: Please do not attempt to bring any cryptocurrency back from the future. We learned this creates what we call "economic paradox cascades."
MAINTENANCE UPDATE: The viewing portal has been cleaned. Previous travelers kept touching it with their popcorn fingers.
QUANTUM OBSERVATION: In at least three parallel timelines, this exact party is happening. In one of them, disco never died.
SYSTEM STATUS: Reality anchors holding at 100%. Last reality fluctuation was minor—someone briefly experienced Wednesday on a Thursday.
TECH SUPPORT MEMO: Yes, we know the wormhole sounds like it's humming a pop song. Dr. Kowalski tuned it that way. We can't change it.
FUN FACT: The Institute's time machine was actually invented in 2089, then sent back in time for assembly. The paperwork was a nightmare.
TEMPORAL TIP: If the destination year looks pixelated, that's just the quantum uncertainty resolving itself. Give it a moment.
