The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta is in full swing. It's basically ancient Greece's World War I, but with more togas and olive oil.
Socrates is currently about 46 years old and annoying everyone in Athens by asking too many questions. Philosophy: it's just professional pestering.
The Parthenon is only about 24 years old—practically brand new! Give it a couple thousand years and some British tourists will take half of it.
Democracy in Athens is thriving! As long as you're a free adult male citizen. Everyone else... not so much voting rights yet.
Plato is approximately 5 years old right now. He's probably just learning to walk. Give him a couple decades to invent Western philosophy.
The Olympic Games have been running for about 370 years at this point. No corporate sponsors yet, but plenty of olive wreaths.
Greek theater is at its peak—Aristophanes is writing comedies, and Sophocles is still producing tragedies. Dinner and a show meant something different back then.
The average Athenian diet consists of bread, olives, figs, cheese, and wine. Honestly? Still a pretty solid Mediterranean diet.
Hippocrates is revolutionizing medicine by suggesting diseases have natural causes rather than angry gods. Controversial take for 423 BCE.
Women in Athens spend most of their time at home managing households. Spartan women have more freedom, which is one of many Sparta vs Athens debates.
Writing is done on papyrus scrolls or wax tablets. The "undo" function is a wet sponge.
The Library of Alexandria won't exist for another 100 years. Currently, if you want information, you find someone who knows things and buy them dinner.
Greek warships called triremes are the aircraft carriers of the ancient world, powered by 170 rowers. Cardio was mandatory.
Silver from the Laurium mines funds Athens' military and civic projects. Ancient stimulus package.
The agora (marketplace) is the social hub of Athens—part mall, part town square, part Twitter. People argue about politics while buying vegetables.
Athenians brush their teeth with crushed bones and oyster shells mixed with honey. Surprisingly, their dental advice is still better than "just use more leeches."
Greek men spend considerable time at the gymnasium—which comes from "gymnos" meaning naked. Yes, they exercised nude. The towel shortage was real.
The owl is sacred to Athena and appears on Athenian coins. It's basically their national bird, security hologram, and good luck charm rolled into one.
Symposiums are drinking parties where men recline on couches, discuss philosophy, and play drinking games. "Truth or Dare" is older than you think.
Greeks believe the gods live on Mount Olympus. On a clear day, you can see the mountain from Athens. The gods have excellent real estate taste.
Olive oil is used for everything: cooking, lamp fuel, moisturizer, athletic training, and religious ceremonies. It's the ancient Greek duct tape.
The concept of "hubris"—excessive pride that angers the gods—is taken very seriously. Greeks basically invented the idea that the universe punishes arrogance.
Persian carpets are luxury items, imported via trade routes. The concept of "rolling out the red carpet" would make sense here.
Dolphins are considered sacred and killing one is punishable by death. Greece was into marine conservation before it was cool.
The sundial is the primary timekeeping device. "What time is it?" is a genuinely difficult question on cloudy days.
Greek fire signals pass messages across islands. It's basically ancient texting, but much more dramatic and visible from neighboring city-states.
Pythagoras already proved his famous theorem about 100 years ago. Students have been suffering through geometry homework ever since.
The penalty for defacing a statue of Hermes (called a herm) is extremely severe. Athens takes its lawn ornaments very seriously.
Should Athens negotiate peace with Sparta? Hawks say "crush them," doves say "we're bleeding gold and soldiers." Sounds familiar.
The Sophists are teaching that truth is relative and arguing is a skill you can sell. Traditional philosophers are FURIOUS. "Paid debaters" is an insult.
Protagoras famously said "Man is the measure of all things." Plato's entire career will be dedicated to saying "Actually, no."
Are the gods real, or just useful stories? Asking this question too loudly in Athens can get you exiled or worse. Socrates will learn this the hard way.
The sophist Gorgias argues you can convince people of anything with good enough rhetoric. Politicians have taken notes for the next 2,400+ years.
Some radical thinkers are questioning whether slavery is natural or just convenient. This is not a popular opinion. The economy runs on it.
Athenian women can't vote, own property, or leave the house unescorted. Spartan women can own land and exercise publicly. Which system is better is heated.
Should we spend more on the navy or the army? Maritime power vs land power debates get heated at the Ekklesia. The navy faction is winning... for now.
Aristophanes writes comedies openly mocking politicians—Cleon has been roasted mercilessly. Somehow this is allowed. The Greeks invented political satire.
Education—should it focus on practical skills (rhetoric, politics) or philosophical truth? The Sophists vs Socrates debate is ancient culture war.
Some philosophers argue the universe is made of atoms in void. Others say it's all fire. Or water. Or math. Ancient physics Twitter would be chaos.
DEBATE RAGING: Is democracy actually good? Oligarchy supporters argue that letting the "uneducated masses" vote leads to bad decisions. This debate will literally never end.
Thucydides is writing history as we speak, arguing we should learn from past mistakes. Bold assumption about humanity there, Thucydides.
Athenian empire—liberator or oppressor? Athens says they're protecting allies. Those "allies" might disagree. Imperialism debates are ancient.
Some intellectuals are arguing that nomos (custom/law) is arbitrary and physis (nature) is the only real authority. Ancient nature vs nurture debate.
The playwright Euripides depicts women with complex inner lives and moral agency. This is considered extremely controversial. Radical feminism—in 423 BCE.
Ditch the pants. Seriously. Wear a chiton (draped cloth) or you'll be immediately identified as a barbarian. Barbarians wear pants.
Learn to recline while eating. Greeks don't sit in chairs at dinner parties—they lounge on couches. Sitting upright is for amateurs.
Never drink undiluted wine. Greeks mix wine with water. Drinking it straight is considered barbaric and a sign of alcoholism.
Get comfortable with nudity at the gymnasium. If you seem embarrassed, you're definitely a time traveler or a Persian spy.
Olive oil is your new best friend. Use it for everything: cooking, bathing, moisturizing, athletic training. Smell like olives or smell suspicious.
Know your Greek gods. If someone mentions Zeus, don't ask "which one?" There's only one Zeus. He just has a lot of affairs.
Don't mention Rome. It's a minor Italian city right now. Saying "Rome will rule the world" will get you laughed at.
Beards are in for men. Clean-shaven faces won't be trendy until Alexander the Great makes it cool in about 100 years.
If asked about your city-state, just say you're from "a small polis in the Peloponnese." Nobody can verify this.
BLENDING IN TIP: Learn to use an abacus. Pulling out a calculator will raise questions you cannot answer.
When in doubt, quote Homer. Everyone here has memorized the Iliad. It's the cultural reference point for everything.
Don't clap at the theater—stamp your feet and shout. Clapping politely is weird here.
