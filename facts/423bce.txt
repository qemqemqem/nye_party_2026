The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta is in full swing. It's basically ancient Greece's World War I, but with more togas and olive oil.
Socrates is currently about 46 years old and annoying everyone in Athens by asking too many questions. Philosophy: it's just professional pestering.
The Parthenon is only about 24 years old—practically brand new! Give it a couple thousand years and some British tourists will take half of it.
Democracy in Athens is thriving! As long as you're a free adult male citizen. Everyone else... not so much voting rights yet.
Plato is approximately 5 years old right now. He's probably just learning to walk. Give him a couple decades to invent Western philosophy.
The Olympic Games have been running for about 370 years at this point. No corporate sponsors yet, but plenty of olive wreaths.
Greek theater is at its peak—Aristophanes is writing comedies, and Sophocles is still producing tragedies. Dinner and a show meant something different back then.
The average Athenian diet consists of bread, olives, figs, cheese, and wine. Honestly? Still a pretty solid Mediterranean diet.
Hippocrates is revolutionizing medicine by suggesting diseases have natural causes rather than angry gods. Controversial take for 423 BCE.

Athenians brush their teeth with crushed bones and oyster shells mixed with honey. Surprisingly, their dental advice is still better than "just use more leeches."
Greek men spend considerable time at the gymnasium—which comes from "gymnos" meaning naked. Yes, they exercised nude. The towel shortage was real.
The owl is sacred to Athena and appears on Athenian coins. It's basically their national bird, security hologram, and good luck charm rolled into one.
Symposiums are drinking parties where men recline on couches, discuss philosophy, and play drinking games. "Truth or Dare" is older than you think.
Greeks believe the gods live on Mount Olympus. On a clear day, you can see the mountain from Athens. The gods have excellent real estate taste.
Olive oil is used for everything: cooking, lamp fuel, moisturizer, athletic training, and religious ceremonies. It's the ancient Greek duct tape.
The concept of "hubris"—excessive pride that angers the gods—is taken very seriously. Greeks basically invented the idea that the universe punishes arrogance.
